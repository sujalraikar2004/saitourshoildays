✨ What the app does

Users fill out a query form (like “I want a Goa trip for 4 people in October”).

The query is sent to the backend and stored safely.

Admins can log in to see all queries and respond.

Users may get a confirmation or response via email.

Everything works on desktop and mobile, so it’s smooth everywhere.
